Terminate a running process by its process ID. Supports both graceful termination and force kill options.

Gracefully terminate a process:
/kill-process:proc_1234567890_1

Force kill a process:
/kill-process:proc_1234567890_1 --force

Use /list-processes to find the process ID of the process you want to terminate. Only running processes can be killed.

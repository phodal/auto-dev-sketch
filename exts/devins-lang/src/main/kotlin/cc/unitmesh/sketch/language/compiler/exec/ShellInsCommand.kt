/**
 * A class that implements the `InsCommand` interface to execute a shell command within the IntelliJ IDEA environment.
 *
 * This class is designed to run a shell command specified by a given `prop` string, which is assumed to be the path to a file within the project.
 * The command is executed in a shell runner service provided by IntelliJ IDEA, using the specified file's path and its parent directory as the working directory.
 *
 * @param myProject The current project context.
 * @param shellFile The path to the file within the project whose content should be executed as a shell command.

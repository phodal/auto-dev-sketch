You are a DDD (Domain-Driven Design) expert building a business-oriented English-Chinese dictionary index from a codebase. You need to extract important concepts from the given code snippets to help others understand and use them.

**Extraction Principles:**

✅ Content that should be extracted:
- Core business entities (e.g.: Blog, Comment, Payment, User as nouns)
- Business concepts and domain models (e.g.: Member, Points, Order)
- Incomprehensible words or pinyin abbreviations
- Domain-specific terminology

❌ Content that should be excluded:
1. Technical vocabulary: Controller, Service, Repository, Mapper, DTO, VO, PO, Entity, Request, Response, Config, Filter, Interceptor, Exception, Helper, Utils, Util, etc.
2. Implementation details and data transfer objects: entries containing suffixes like "Request", "Response", "Dto", "Entity"
3. Technical operation verbs: validate, check, convert, deserialize, serialize, encode, decode, etc.
4. Technical operations in method names: e.g., "checkIfVipAccount" should extract only "VIP Account", "isLimitExceeded" should extract only "Limit"
5. Common library APIs (e.g., Spring, OkHttp, Retrofit) and common class names (e.g., List, Map)

**Processing Rules:**
1. If the extracted entry contains technical suffixes (e.g., "CreateCommentDto"), convert it to pure business concepts (e.g., "Comment" not "Create Comment Data Transfer Object")
2. If method names contain technical operations (e.g., "checkIfVipAccount"), extract business meaning ("VIP Account" not "Check If VIP Account")
3. If class names contain technical vocabulary suffixes, remove the suffix before adding to the dictionary

**Output Format Requirements:**

✅ MUST return CSV format (comma-separated values)
✅ CSV header: Chinese,English,Description
✅ Each line contains one concept: [Chinese],[English],[Description]
✅ Return ONLY data, no other text, explanations, tables, or markdown formatting
✅ If data contains commas, wrap the field in double quotes, e.g.: "Concept A,Concept B",CodeConcept,Description

Example:
```
Chinese,English,Description
博客,Blog,a blog post
评论,Comment,a comment on a blog
支付,Payment,a payment transaction
```

Based on the following filenames and code snippets, extract important business concepts and return them in CSV format:

/**
 * Kotlin-specific suffix rules for generating optimal LLM context.
 * Removes Spring/common framework suffixes and Kotlin-specific technical patterns.
 * 
 * Key differences from Java:
 * - Includes Kotlin-specific suffixes like "Kt" (for file-level functions)
 * - Handles data classes, sealed classes, and object declarations
 * - Considers extension function patterns
